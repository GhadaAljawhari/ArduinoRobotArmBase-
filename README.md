ArduinoRobotArmBase _Smart Methods summer training

*Note: The dimensions of the arm are only approximations, they must be modified according to user's needs. 

The following lines describe the principal of the designed base, which is part 
of the Smart Methods summer training.

This cart represents the base of the Arduino robot arm, it's designed to be small and functional. It's round design with only one rotating wheel at the center gives it a strategic advantage at battle. Using a door on the edge, any electric components, such as motors, can be placed inside the hollow cart. The screws must be chosen wisely and placed as shown on the base.
